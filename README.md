# Book Search
Took starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Description
---

Book search is a website that you can use to search and save books, backed by a google api.  If you have an account you can save books to a saved books list (and then delete them if you no longer want them on the list).  

I added a link to the title in the searchbooks, and savedbooks pages so that the user can directly link to the google books page should they wish.  

## Installation
---

The website can be viewed [here](https://book-search-co.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku, or if you wish to run locally, clone the repo then `npm i` in the terminal to install dependancies.  

## Usage
---

Simply open the website and type in any book title to the search bar, you'll then see a list of books related to that title.  From there if you are logged in you'll see the 'save this book' button, otherwise sign up for an account.  

## Screenshots
---
A user can search the database for any book and it returns results based on that search.  Once logged in a user can save books to their account and revisit them later should they wish:
